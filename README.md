# Sorting-visualizer

Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer project! ðŸš€ This interactive web application allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action, helping you understand their behaviors and differences.

## Features

- **Real-time Visualization:** Witness sorting algorithms in action as they rearrange elements in real-time.
- **Multiple Algorithms:** Explore popular sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.
- **Customizable Inputs:** Adjust input data size to observe sorting performance with different data complexities.
- **Step-by-Step Playback:** Control the visualization with playback options to follow each sorting step closely.
- **Interactive UI:** Intuitive interface for easy algorithm selection, visualization control, and data size adjustment.

## How to Use

1. Open the Sorting Visualizer in your web browser.
2. Set the array size slider to select the number of elements to be sorted and the speed slider to select the sorting speed.
3. Choose a sorting algorithm from the menu and click it to begin the visualization
4. Observe the sorting process step by step.
5. Utilize "Reset to default" to reset the size and speed.
6. Experiment with different algorithms and data sizes to compare their performances.
